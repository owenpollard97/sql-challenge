This project focuses on analyzing employee data from the 1980s and 1990s, stored across six CSV files in regards to a hypothetical company, Pewlett Hackard. 
As a hypothetical new data engineer, my task involved data modeling, engineering, and analysis to provide insights from these records.

There were three main objectives within this hypothetical project. I describe them below:

- Data Modeling: Where I tables to organize the data from the 6 CSVs. After that, I was able to create an ERD.
- Data Engineering: I imported the CSV files into a SQL database
- Data Analysis: Finally, I created queries in PgAdmin4 to gain specific info about certain employees, departments, and certain demographics within the company during that specified period.

Overall, the entire project's goal was to learn more about the company's historical data whether that be employees hired in a certain time period, department managers and what they manage, amongst many other varying insights about the company during the specified time period.
